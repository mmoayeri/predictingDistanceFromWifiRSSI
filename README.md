# predictingDistanceFromWifiRSSI
very introductory mechanisms for modeling distance based on wifi RSSI strengths

Basic data processing, curve fitting, and neural network training shown. I have not provided the data here because it does not belong to me, but the data expected is a csv of RSSI strengths and log distance measurements. 

Code was developed in colab. I made this as a favor to my dad who was interested in this kind of modeling. 

The intent of this code is more so a demo in using these tools as opposed to creating any results. If anything, maybe this framework can be useful for some.
